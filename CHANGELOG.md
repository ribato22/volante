## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Supervisor + routing engine: goal → validated task DAG → per-task model routing (by strengths and
  tool support) → scoped, budget-capped projection → wave execution (async fan-out, fail-fast) →
  synthesis, with a `CostMeter` (per-model usage/cost, estimated-flag propagation).
- Provider adapters: `AnthropicProvider` and a tool-capable `OpenAICompatProvider`, plus one or more
  generic OpenAI-compatible slots (`OPENAI_COMPAT_*`, then `OPENAI_COMPAT_2_*`, `OPENAI_COMPAT_3_*`,
  …) for any endpoints (Gemini / Groq / OpenRouter / DeepSeek / Ollama) at once — each with its own
  model_id, pricing, and context window, enabling genuine cross-provider orchestration.
- Hybrid execution: one-shot workers and an agentic model↔tool loop (`run_python` sandbox,
  host-mediated `fetch_url` / `read_file`).
- Isolation: subprocess `Sandbox` (process-group kill, `RLIMIT_CPU`, scrubbed env) and an opt-in
  `DockerSandbox` (`--network none`, read-only root, cgroup limits).
- Streaming across supervisor / workers / synthesizer, with per-task labelled parallel-worker
  streaming and cooperative early-stop.
- Evaluation: 5 composite goals, a 3-arm comparison (baseline / orchestration / agentic-single), and
  a forgery-resistant scorer using process + filesystem separation with a nonce-authenticated RPC.
- Optional Web UI (`webui/`): a FastAPI + Server-Sent-Events app that streams a run live in the
  browser (plan, per-task worker output, synthesis, result); uses real providers or a no-key
  `FakeProvider` demo. Install with the `ui` extra; run via `python -m webui`.
- Project docs: README, LICENSE (MIT), SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CI, and design specs under `docs/`.
